A repository for the teaching materials on deep learning for glacier mapping from the Machine Learning for Glaciology workshop, Finse Alpine Research Centre, Norway. This part of the workshop covers glacier mapping with the use of pixel-based methods such as random forests and deep learning models for semantic image segmentation.

## Teaching materials

**TODO**

Note that the datasets and the pretrained models are available only on [Hub](https://hub.jupytearth.org/).

## Project

**TODO**

> We will update the materials during the workshop. If you notice any inaccuracies, mistakes or errors, feel free to submit a pull request.
